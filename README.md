# React Image Gallery Slider

This is a simple project of a React image gallery slider component. Currently, the only way to use this project is to copy and paste the `ImageSlider` component itself. It requires Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

**Note:** I plan on turning this into a package you can easily use and customize, but right now I don't have the time.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-image-gallery-slider.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Copy and paste the `ImageSlider` component into your React project.

```jsx
// Example usage in your React component
import ImageSlider from './path/to/ImageSlider';

function App() {
	return (
		<div className='App'>
			<ImageSlider />
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-use image gallery slider component.
- Utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## TODO

- [ ] Apply the accessibility labels.
- [ ] Add bullet points for each image in the slider.
- [ ] Add customization options (a lot of work).
- [ ] Publish as a package for easy installation and usage.
